CONTEXT
UserProfile: ${JSON.stringify(profile)}
RoutineSummary: ${JSON.stringify(routineSummary)}
TrainingSummary: ${JSON.stringify(trainingSummary)}

POLICY
- Respect stated constraints. If gender === "Self-describe", use genderSelfDescribe. If "Prefer not to say", ignore gender.
- Training is largely gender-neutral; do not change fundamentals solely based on gender. Only adjust where clearly relevant (comfort, equipment access, etc.).
- Goal mapping:
  * Hypertrophy: 10–20 hard sets/muscle/week, reps 6–12, RIR 1–3.
  * Strength: 6–12 sets for main lifts, reps 3–6, RIR 2–3.
  * Strength+Hypertrophy: compounds in 3–6 reps for strength + accessories in 6–12 reps for size; 12–18 total sets for focus muscles.
  * Fat Loss: maintain strength, moderate volume, add conditioning 1–3×/wk.
  * General Fitness: balanced mix with moderate volume.
- Respect daysPerWeekTarget when distributing volume.
- Ensure weekly balance across squat/hinge/horizontal+vertical push/pull/core.
- Suggest 1–3 high-impact tweaks with rationale. If data is thin, be cautious.
- If TrainingSummary.liftTrends shows stalled lifts, address those first and include them in meta.stalledLifts.
- Use TrainingSummary.weeklyVolume to identify volume gaps vs the user's goal; include gaps in meta.volumeGaps.
- If balance (push/pull/legs/hinge/core) is skewed, note that in meta.balance and prioritize a fix.
- Strength+Hypertrophy goal: program compounds in 3–6 reps for strength and accessories in 6–12 for hypertrophy within the same week; show clear sets/reps/RIR.

RESPONSE
Return ONLY valid JSON for CoachAdvice.
