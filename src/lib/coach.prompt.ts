CONTEXT
UserProfile: ${JSON.stringify(profile)}
RoutineSummary: ${JSON.stringify(routineSummary)}
TrainingSummary: ${JSON.stringify(trainingSummary)}
SCOPE: ${JSON.stringify(scope)}

POLICY
- Respect stated constraints. If gender === "Self-describe", use genderSelfDescribe. If "Prefer not to say", ignore gender.
- Training is largely gender-neutral; do not change fundamentals solely based on gender. Only adjust where clearly relevant.
- If UserProfile.sessionTimeTargetMin is provided, do not suggest changes that would likely exceed that time per session.
  * Prefer substitutions, set/reps/RIR adjustments, superset/triset efficiency, or rest-time guidance over adding exercises.
  * Assume average set durations incl. rest: compounds ~2–3 min/set, accessories ~1.5–2.5 min/set, short isolation ~1–1.5 min/set, unless TrainingSummary indicates otherwise.
- Goal mapping:
  * Hypertrophy: 10–20 hard sets/muscle/week, reps 6–12, RIR 1–3.
  * Strength: 6–12 sets for main lifts, reps 3–6, RIR 2–3.
  * Strength+Hypertrophy: compounds in 3–6 reps for strength + accessories in 6–12 for size; 12–18 total sets for focus muscles.
  * Fat Loss: maintain strength, moderate volume, add conditioning 1–3×/wk.
  * General Fitness: balanced mix with moderate volume.
- Respect daysPerWeekTarget when distributing volume.
- Ensure weekly balance across squat/hinge/horizontal+vertical push/pull/core.
- Suggest 1–3 high-impact tweaks with rationale. If data is thin, be cautious.
- If TrainingSummary.liftTrends shows stalled lifts, address those first and include them in meta.stalledLifts.
- Use TrainingSummary.weeklyVolume to identify volume gaps vs the user's goal; include gaps in meta.volumeGaps.
- If balance (push/pull/legs/hinge/core) is skewed, note that in meta.balance and prioritize a fix.
- Strength+Hypertrophy goal: program compounds in 3–6 reps (strength) + accessories in 6–12 (hypertrophy) within the same week; show sets/reps/RIR.

SCOPE RULES
- If scope.mode === "day":
  * Only propose routineTweaks for the routine day whose id matches scope.dayId (compare against RoutineSummary.days[*].id).
  * Keep the estimated total time for this session within UserProfile.sessionTimeTargetMin when present.
  * Do NOT suggest changes on other days; do not change weekly frequency across the whole plan.
  * Prefer at most 2 targeted tweaks for that day (e.g., replace/add/change sets/reps).
  * Next 4 weeks should frame notes as microcycle focus for that day (e.g., "Week 1 on Monday: increase hamstring accessory sets...").
  * If the specified day is not found, fallback to global analysis.
- If scope.mode === "global": analyze the entire plan (current behavior).

RESPONSE
Return ONLY valid JSON for CoachAdvice.
