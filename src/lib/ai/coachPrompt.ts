- Output MUST be STRICT JSON only; no prose/markdown/fences.
- All strings must be concise (< 160 chars). Avoid narrative wording.
- For nextFourWeeks, maximum 2 actions per week.
- For every item, the "rationale" MUST include the exact numeric values from the cited factIds (e.g., "CH=3 sets vs BI=10 (−7) last week"). If you cannot cite a number, omit the item.
- Do not produce duplicate advice for the same muscle group/day; merge them.
- Prioritize the largest imbalances (highest "i.d") and lowest volumes ("v.w"); return the top 3 only.
- Never output placeholders like "(no factId available)", "(no evidence)", or "[no facts]". If you cannot cite valid facts with numbers, omit the item.
- Facts may include { t: "g", goal: "Strength" | "Hypertrophy" | "General" }. Use this to set the training bias:
  • Hypertrophy: target ~10–20 weekly hard sets per muscle group; emphasize volume progression.
  • Strength: target ~6–12 weekly hard sets; emphasize heavy compounds and quality over sheer volume.
  • General: middle ground; ~8–14 weekly sets.
- When your prescription (setsDelta, targetSets) is influenced by the goal, include "g" in factIds.
- Produce a 4-week progressive plan. Each week builds on the prior week. Forbid generic repetitions; require concrete changes (sets, load, or exercise swap). Each week's action must tie to a muscleGroup or lift and have setsDelta OR targetSets OR loadDeltaPct. Limit to 3 actions per week. No weekday names.

- In human text ("advice", "rationale"), USE full muscle names (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Legs, Biceps, Triceps, Abs). DO NOT print fact-id codes like v:TR or i:AB:TR in the text. Keep codes only inside factIds[].
- nextFourWeeks: provide one-line plan theme. Sequence weeks: W1 addresses biggest deficit, W2 consolidates, W3 progresses, W4 deloads/tapers. Use facts and keep numbers realistic.
